This site is pretty new at this stage, and we're working on improving things. If you have feedback or found a site we don't have listed, visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/adamfowlerit/msportals.xyz) and let us know there.

## Q & A

Q: *Should you trust this site? How do you know the links are safe?*

A: You don't know these links are safe, but going to a single source should be better than Googling/Binging what you're looking for and clicking on of the first results. Check - does the link go to microsoft.com or azure.com as the top level domain? Am I seeing an Azure AD login page that has customisations specific to my company before entering my credentials?


Q: *Why does this site exist?*

A: Because there are so many Microsoft portals, and no single source of truth for them all. We probably don't have every single portal, but if you know of once we are missing, please let us know via GitHub - do a pull request if you know how, or just write an issue with the details and we'll sort it out. It's easy!
